# Application Flow

## Status after Milestone 2

No storefront/cart/checkout flows exist yet (Milestone 4+) - Milestone 2 is
Admin-only catalog management. What's live today:

### Public / customer-facing (MVC, cookie auth)

- `GET /` - home page placeholder.
- `GET /Account/Register`, `POST /Account/Register` - creates the account
  (assigned the `Customer` role), signs the user in immediately.
- `GET /Account/Login`, `POST /Account/Login` - validates credentials
  (generic error on failure, distinct message when locked out), signs in via
  cookie, redirects to `returnUrl` only if it passes `Url.IsLocalUrl`.
- `POST /Account/Logout` - clears the cookie.
- `GET/POST /Account/ForgotPassword` - always shows the same confirmation
  regardless of whether the email is registered; sends a reset email (dev:
  written to `Logs/DevEmails/*.html`) only when it is.
- `GET/POST /Account/ResetPassword` - consumes the token, updates the
  password, revokes all the user's active refresh tokens.
- `GET/POST /Account/ChangePassword` (`[Authorize]`) - requires the current
  password, refreshes the cookie (since Identity rotates the security stamp
  on password change), revokes all active refresh tokens.
- `GET /Account/Profile` (`[Authorize]`) - name, email, roles, member-since,
  last-login.
- `POST /Account/RevokeAllSessions` (`[Authorize]`) - revokes every refresh
  token and bumps the security stamp, then signs the current session out too.

### Admin (MVC, cookie auth, role-gated)

- `GET /Admin/Home/Index` - dashboard placeholder. Requires one of
  `SuperAdmin`/`Admin`/`CatalogManager`/`InventoryManager`/`OrderManager`/
  `CustomerSupport` (`Roles.StaffRolesCsv`); anonymous requests redirect to
  login, authenticated non-staff (e.g. `Customer`) get redirected to
  `/Home/AccessDenied` (403).
- `/Admin/Categories`, `/Admin/Brands`, `/Admin/ProductAttributes`,
  `/Admin/Products` - full catalog CRUD, gated by the `CanManageCatalog`
  policy (`SuperAdmin`/`Admin`/`CatalogManager`). See `Admin-User-Guide.md`
  for the full feature list.

### API (`/api/v1/auth`, JWT bearer)

- `POST register` - creates the account and returns `{ user, tokens }`.
- `POST login` - validates credentials and returns `{ user, tokens }`.
- `POST refresh` - rotates the refresh token; reuse of an already-rotated
  token revokes the whole chain for that user.
- `POST logout` (`[Authorize]`) - revokes the presented refresh token.
- `POST revoke-all` (`[Authorize]`) - revokes every refresh token for the
  caller.
- `GET me` (`[Authorize]`) - the caller's profile.

### Infra

- `GET /health/live`, `GET /health/ready` - unchanged from the Foundation
  milestone.
- Unmapped routes still resolve to the branded 404 page.

This document is filled in feature-by-feature as each remaining milestone
lands (browsing, cart, checkout, order processing, returns, etc.).
